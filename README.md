# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
- A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate on.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this code is to discover insights into the election, and discover what candidate won, what the spread was, and what votes were cast from the different counties being represented here.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane.
- The counties represented here were Jefferson, Denver & Arapahoe.

### Candidate Results
The candidate results were:
- Charles Casper Stockham got 23.0% of the vote, with 85,213 votes. 
- Diana DeGette got 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes. 
- Finally, Raymon Anthony Doane got 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes.

<strong>Winner of the Election</strong><br>
The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, with 73.8% of the total vote.
 
### County Results
The county results were:
- Jefferson: 10.5% of the votes, with 38,855 votes cast from there.
- Denver: 82.8% of the votes, with 306,055 votes.
- Arapahoe: 6.7% of the votes, with 24,801 votes.

<strong>Highest County Turnout</strong><br>
Denver had the highest county turnout, with a 82.8% of the total vote.

## Setbacks & Challenges
Based on our results, there may have been some setbacks. For one, of the counties representated, Denver held 82.8% of the vote. Based on the population of the county, this may be proportional to the overall population of the 3 counties. However, when one county has such a big vote (82.8%), one may be weary that the one county is disporportionally affecting the election turnout. 
<br>Going off of this previous point, seeing a location breakdown for each candidate would be helpful to also figuring out where each candidate's voter bases lie.

<br>Another issue we may see with this code is that it isn't the most effecient and easy to read. Other libraries in Python such as Pandas make reading CSV files much easier to work with. From a development perspective, Pandas makes the code much easier to read as well. Pandas also allows for descriptive functionality as well, which can provide greater insights into the data that was collected.

### Other Uses for the Code
To re-use this code, we could make minor modifications and accomplish the following for other elections:
1.  <strong>Calculate Voter Turnouts</strong>: Since we know that Denver held 82.8% of the votes cast, we may want to see how porportional this is to the entire population of the 3 counties combined. Therefore, adding a voter turnout as a percentage of the county's total population would be beneficial to seeing as to whether or not a county had equitable representation relative to the others. In the code, we would need to research the populations of each county, and then add a dictionary in the following format: <br><code>county_populations = {'Arapahoe': 656,590, 'Denver': ...etc }</code> Once we establish this, we can divide the total turnouts for each county by their total population (and then multiply by 100), and get the percent of population that voted. If there is an extreme difference in percent of voter turnouts, then the election commission can make future elections better by making sure underrepresented counties are equal with the others, to avoid voting biases based on location.   

2. <strong>Location Representation For Each Candidate</strong>: Similar to the last idea, to utilize the existing code without adding any new dictionaries of external information, the election commission could add a breakdown of locations that voted for each candidate. To do this, we would need to add dictionaries inside of the "candidate_votes" dictionary for each candidate that would break down each candidate by votes per a location. For example, the dictionary would look like the following: <br><code>candidate_votes = {'Charles Casper Stockham': {'Denver':  57188, 'Arapahoe': 8302, 'Jefferson':19723 }, 'Diana DeGette':{ ... etc</code>. With this, for each candidate, the code would need to add the total of the 3 counties to get their overall vote. This could also optimize the code better, since this newly updated dictionary would also track overall county turnout too.

<strong>Also useful improvements (not part of Module)</strong>: Visual Analysis of the results in pie charts with Excel charts, Tableau or MatPlotLib. To optimize the code, we can use the Pandas library as well.
